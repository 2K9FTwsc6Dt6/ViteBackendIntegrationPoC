# ViteBackendIntegrationPoC

Not like a
[Vue frontend and ASP.NET Core backend](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-asp-net-core-with-vue?view=vs-2022),
but an **ASP.NET Core MVC app with the assets from Vue** instead, as explained
[here](https://vite.dev/guide/backend-integration) and implemented
[here](https://github.com/Eptagone/Vite.AspNetCore).
