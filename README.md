# ViteBackendIntegrationPoC

Not like a Vue frontend and an ASP.NET Core backend
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-asp-net-core-with-vue?view=vs-2022>,
but like an ASP.NET Core MVC app with the assets from Vue like here
<https://vite.dev/guide/backend-integration>
and more specifically here
<https://github.com/Eptagone/Vite.AspNetCore>.
